# Lesson 303.10 - Polymorphism, Object Type casting, Abstraction, interfaces

This assignment is divided into two parts.  The first part is a coding portion that will be provided in the project folder.  The second part is a HackerRank challenge.

## 303.10.1 - Polymorphism and Inheritance

From the document [PA 303.10.1](<Docs/PA 303.10.1 - Practice Assignment - Polymorphism and inheritance.pdf>):

**Scenario:** In our game app, we have many types of monsters that can attack. You will design a superclass called **Monster** and define the method of ***attack()*** in the superclass. You will design subclasses called **FireMonster**, **WaterMonster**, and **StoneMonster**. The subclasses will then provide their actual implementation. In the main program, we will declare instances of the superclass, substitute them with the actual subclass, and invoke the method defined in the superclass.

## 303.10.2 - Abstraction
